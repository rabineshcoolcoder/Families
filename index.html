            <p class="text-capitalize">i love my aunt very much and she is very kind to me, also her name is sajini! she does not work since she has a little, cute baby! she takes care of the baby and my cousin very well!! her age is 46. i always support her and make her happy!</p>

            <h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

            <p class="text-capitalize">An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. Alternate terms include auntie or aunty. Children in other cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap. The word comes from Lati and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece. The gender-neutral term pibling, a shortened form of parent's sibling, may refer to either an aunt or an uncle.</p>

            <br>

            <h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

            <p class="text-capitalize">An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent, as well as the parent of the cousins. Uncles who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. The female counterpart of an uncle is an aunt, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece. The word comes from Latin, and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. The gender-neutral term pibling, a shortened form of parent's sibling, may refer to either an aunt or an uncle. In some cultures and families, children may refer to the cousins of their parents as uncle (or aunt). It is also used as a title of respect for older relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, family friends, and even total strangers in some cultures, for example Aboriginal Australian elders. Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship.</p>

            <h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

            <p class="text-capitalize">A cousin is a relative that is the child of a parent's sibling; this is more specifically referred to as a first cousin. More generally, in the kinship system used in the English-speaking world, a cousin is a type of relationship in which relatives are two or more generations away from their most recent common ancestor. For this definition degrees and removals are used to further specify the relationship. Degree measures how distant the relationship is from the most recent common ancestor(s). If the cousins do not come from the same generation, removal is specified, as removal measures the difference in generations between the two cousins. When the removal is not specified, no removal is assumed.</p>

            <h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

            <p class="text-capitalize">Grandparents, individually known as grandmother and grandfather, are the parents of a person's father or mother, paternal or maternal. Every sexually reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, sixty-four genetic great-great-great-great grandparents, etc. In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased. It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost. an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.</p>

            <p class="text-capitalize">An infant or baby is the very young offspring of human beings. Infant (from the Latin word infans, meaning 'baby' or 'child') is a formal or specialised synonym for the common term baby. The terms may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms. A newborn is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to one month old. In medical contexts, a newborn or neonate is an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants.</p>

            <p class="text-capitalize">A child (pl. children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. It may also refer to an unborn human being. In English-speaking countries, the legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, in this case as a person younger than the local age of majority (there are exceptions like, for example, the consume and purchase of alcoholic beverage even after said age of majority), regardless of their physical, mental and sexual development as biological adults. Children generally have fewer rights and responsibilities than adults. They are generally classed as unable to make serious decisions.</p>

Founded in the 1800s as a fishing village, Dubai has emerged as a major center for regional and international trade since the early 20th century and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and luxury. It has the second-most five-star hotels in the world and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall. In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub.</p>

                    <p class="text-capitalize">Thekkady (Idukki district) is a town near Periyar National Park, an important tourist attraction in the Kerala state of India. The name Thekkady is derived from the word "thekku" which means teak. Temperatures are lowest in the months of December to January and highest in the months of April to May. Thekkady is situated about 257 km (160 mi) from Trivandrum, 145 km from Cochin International Airport and 114 km from Kottayam railway station. It is 4 km from Kumily, a plantation town on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The sanctuary is famous for its dense evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous forests and savanna grass lands. It is home to herds of elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur, lion-tailed macaques and Nilgiri langurs. Due to the density of the forest, sightings of elephants and especially tigers are highly unlikely.</p>

                    <p class="text-capitalize">Coimbatore, sometimes shortened as Kovai, is one of the major metropolitan cities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the banks of the Noyyal River and surrounded by the Western Ghats. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai in terms of population and the 16th largest urban agglomeration in India as per the census 2011. It is the administrative capital of Coimbatore District and is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation which was established in 1981. The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams.</p>

                    <p class="text-capitalize">Yercaud, also spelt Erkad, is a town and hill station in Salem District in Tamil Nadu, India. Located in Servarayan Hills in the Eastern Ghats, it is situated at an altitude of 1,515 m (4,970 ft). Stone-age implements have been found near an ancient shrine located in the Servarayan Hills, about 5 km from the Yercaud lake. In the 1820s, M. D. Cockburn, the collector of Salem district facilitated the establishment of coffee plantations and citrus fruit saplings imported from South Africa. It was later discovered by Thomas Munro, the Governor of Madras Presidency in 1842 and popularized as a recreation retreat. It is located in the Shevaroy hills in the Eastern Ghats. The total extent of Yercaud taluk is 382.67 km2 (147.75 sq mi) including reserve forests. It is situated at an altitude of 1,515 metres (4,970 ft) above sea level, and the highest point in Yercaud is the Servarayan temple, at 1,628 m (5,342 ft).</p>
